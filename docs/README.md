Here you'll find the developer documentation for the Smart Core API.

This is a Vuepress site that builds markdown files into a static website.

## Building

To build run `yarn build` which will output the static files into the `dist` folder.

## Developing

Run `yarn dev` to start a hot-reloading dev server hosting the docs.

Vuepress has some limitations on what gets reloaded on the fly. Typically markdown content does get reloaded, page level changes, config, or options will not - including the navigation pane.

# Smart Core API
This repository contains the interface definitions for the base Smart Core functionality. Looking at the .proto files
should give a better understanding of how to communicate between different services in a Smart core system.
 
In addition, this repository also holds the generated go dependencies necessary for working with these APIs, and a
pom file for generating the published java dependencies. See readme files in the language folders for details of
updating or publishing these dependencies.
